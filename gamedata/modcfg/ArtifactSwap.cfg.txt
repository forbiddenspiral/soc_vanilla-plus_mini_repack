 File: ArtifactSwap.cfg

The Artifact Swap minimod extends the vanilla gameplay by 
providing a new set of goals involving the acquisition of 
new and better artifacts.

The idea is that there's a company providing Skinflint with 
expensive artifacts that have been synthesized with existing 
ones.  They are not only expensive, they require replacement 
artifacts of the type used in their manufacture.

Only someone with a lot of time will have the ability to 
acquire both the money and the artifacts in order to swap 
them for much better ones.  The new artifacts reduce the 
micromanagement needed to protect against the various kinds 
of Zone threats.

To be able to swap artifacts, you need to keep Skinflint 
alive.  The options will appear after you have completed 
the village bloodsucker task, and the types of artifacts 
along with the requirements will be listed in the dialog 
and subsequently in your PDA log.

If you have the Quest Overhaul enabled, there will 
be a storage box under the nearby stairwell for your use.


Skinflint Pricing

Skinflint can offer you better pricing if you are friends 
(green) with Freedom.


Surprise Boxes

You can enable the rare chance to find good artifacts in 
certain boxes and cases (the kind known as def_box if you 
are a modder). You can also change the odds. A value of 
50 will result in your finding a surprise in about one 
case or crate per game.

Do not set the value lower than 1. That value will yield 
a surprise out of every def_box in the game (about 50).

You can change the surprise list in xr_box.script if you 
are careful to use the correct section names of the 
objects you want to spawn. See the box_treats table.
