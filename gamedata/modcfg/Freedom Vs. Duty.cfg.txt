 File: Freedom Vs. Duty.cfg

Author:  MrSeyker

This config file will let you enable joining the Freedom or 
Duty factions after completing a number of jobs for them.

Duty: Complete the RG-6 mission for Voronin.

Freedom: Kill the Duty detachment, deal with the snitch 
successfully and protect the Barrier.

As a Freedomer, you get access to the armory. You can also 
gain access if you fail just one mission, either the snitch 
or the barrier one.

You can optionally gain access to the Freedom armory after 
joining Freedom, although you will need to talk to the 
armory guard first.

Note: This ZRP version utilizes the vanilla info_portion 
mil_arsenal_inside instead of the arsenal_guard_talked 
info_portion that was added in the separate Freedom Vs. 
Duty mod by MrSeyker.


Faction Relationship Tweaks

With this entry you can modify the default relationships of 
factions with you if you have joined a faction.

As a Duty member you can be friends with Duty.

As a Freedom member you can be neutral with Ecologists, and 
you can adjust the attitudes of Ecologists toward Freedom 
members and vice versa. And you can make Mercs hostile toward 
you as they are toward other Freedomers.
