 File: Experimental.cfg

This configuration contains some not-fully-tested tweaks.


===============
The Sim_statistic Debug Options stuff has moved to the Respawn 
Control configuration (RespawnerControl.cfg).


===============
Alternative Pripyat Gulag
Alternative Lab X16 Gulag - removed; not supported in new game

Alex-Tommy has made some suggestions to improve the operation of 
the game; see the "Alternative Pripyat Gulag" entry. 


===============
Explosives Carry - Light
Explosives Carry - Heavy

You can carry (or at least pick up) explosives if you enable the 
ability to do so.  This feature allows you to selectively enable 
the can_take attribute of six different explosive containers in 
the game, half of which are light enough to be carried in the 
vanilla game.

Use the tooltips to see the current weight of the fuel cans, 
canisters, tanks and barrels, as well as that of the dynamite 
box.

If you enable the heavy items without changing the weight you can 
carry, you will be able to pick up the heavy containers but you 
will not be able to walk with them.  You might find it useful to 
help you get barrels up steps. 

Note that not all barrels, fuel tanks, etc. in the game are 
explosive items.  If you look at a red barrel while close to it 
you should see a prompt to pick it up if it is an explosive one. 


===============
Explosives Weight - Light
Explosives Weight - Heavy

You can use this option to change the default weight for the 
six types of explosive containers you can enable to carry.


===============
Live Stalker Ranking

Mr. Fusion's AI tweak is now in the Experimental_AI.cfg 
configuration file.


===============
NPC Smart Flashlights

This AI tweak has been moved to the Experimental_AI.cfg 
configuration file.


===============
NPP Blowout Timer

You can set the default countdown value at any time prior to 
triggering the blowout timer at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.


===============
Psi Emitter

The vanilla game normally uses rupture damage to lower your health 
while you are in a psi field like that around the Brain Scorcher. 
The ZRP default is to lower your mental health (the blue bar in 
inventory) instead.  If you wish to return to the vanilla effect, 
check the checkbox and click Apply.


===============
Time on HUD

This tweak has been promoted to the _ZRP.cfg configuration file.


===============
Weapons

These settings affect the config\weapons\weapons.ltx file.

The hit_probability_max_dist is the maximum distance from you at 
which the full probability of the difficulty setting (typically 
20% at novice to 50% at master) is applied.  The percentage of 
hits to shots fired will drop off beyond this distance.

The default distance is 10 meters.  Set it higher to increase 
the accuracy of the NPCs.

NOTE:  This does not apply to your accuracy.  That is determined 
by the accuracy of the gun combined with the accuracy adjustment 
determined by your stance and whether you are aiming or not. 
A gauss rifle in good condition will always hit the target if 
you aim or low-crouch.  See the debug notes to learn how to 
display the damage you are doing to NPCs and mutants.


Both fire_dispersion_base_k and bullet_hit_power_k affect your 
weapon when an add-on silencer is attached.  Normally such a 
silenced weapon is 25% less accurate and hits with 20% less damage. 
You can tweak it to keep the weapon's default accuracy (1.0) or 
even improve it (e.g., 1.25).

This only applies to the default add-on silencer in the vanilla 
game.  It does not affect weapons that are silenced by default.


===============
Weather:

Don't use the Weather tweak if you already use a mod that modifies 
the weather.

You have three choices besides the default:

"Good Weather on All Maps, Soft Rain after Midnight" - It rains softly 
a couple of times in the wee hours of the morning, and 
the weather will still cloud over from time to time.

"Normal Weather on All Maps" - The standard weather that you see in 
the Cordon and other places can now also be had in Dark Valley, Yantar, 
Red Forest, Pripyat and the two NPP outdoor levels.

"Normal Weather on All Maps, No Lightning Bolts" - This attempts to 
remove the lightning from the normal weather.
