These utilities provide the player with the ability to fix 
or work around most problems, as well as spawn stuff and 
run scripts or even execute Lua script statements inside 
the game. 

There are two parts to getting started:

You need to enable the interface dialog.  It's the first 
item, "Enable ZRP Support Utilities".  Then make sure the 
checkbox for "Allow ZRP Support Utilities" is checked and 
click the Apply button.

You also need to install the script(s) you wish to use.

To access these scripts while in the game, press Esc to 
display the main menu after starting a game or loading a 
save.  Then press Z to show the ZSU dialog.

Please see the docs\ZRP_SupportUtilities_Manual.txt file for 
more complete details.
