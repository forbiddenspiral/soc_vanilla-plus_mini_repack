Please see the warning about mod compatibility below before using this 
program.  Also note that some changes may require starting a new game. 


==================================================
Installation:

This program must be placed in the gamedata\ directory of the mod you 
wish to configure. While its configuration and help files can also be 
placed there, it is better to keep them in a modcfg\ subdirectory under 
gamedata\.  If modcfg\ exists, config files elsewhere will be ignored. 

A shortcut can be placed on your desktop by right-click-dragging the 
Modifier.exe icon from the Windows Explorer pane to the desktop, then 
selecting "Create shortcuts here". 

You will need write permission for that STALKER gamedata directory and 
subdirectories to run this program, as it needs to modify the mod's 
configuration and script files.  While the easiest way to do this is 
to run the program with administrator rights or at least sufficient 
privilege to allow this modification, it is recommended that you simply 
change the directory access permission.

To find out how to do this, consult the help support for your version 
of Windows.  In Windows XP:  Open Explorer and select Help > Help and 
Support Center.  Select "System Administration", then select "Access 
Control".  Select "Set, view, change, or remove file and folder 
permissions".

      **** IMPORTANT NOTE FOR FOLKS WITH VISTA/WINDOWS 7 ****

It is possible that the game may not see your changes to the STALKER 
gamedata directory unless you have ownership of the STALKER gamedata 
subdirectory. This often happens when you use installers -- those can 
take ownership for themselves. 

This means that your changes go to a shadow copy of the STALKER 
gamedata subdirectory.  It is like the desktop, where you see several 
icons.  Some belong to the All Users subdirectory, and some to the 
directory with your login name.

When you examine the gamedata files in Windows, it seems like the 
changes are there, but when you launch the game, it will use the 
original (but now hidden) files put there by the installer.

One possible workaround is to rename the gamedata directory before you 
make any changes, then copy the renamed directory to the STALKER 
installation directory and rename the copy as "gamedata".  When this 
is done in Windows Explorer, the copy should belong to you.

You would still need write permission; see above.

Alternatively, you could take ownership of the directory yourself. 
Search the web for info on how to do that.

==================================================
Running the program:

Choose the configuration set from those in the list in the drop-down 
combobox in the upper left corner. The configurable items will appear 
in the listbox on the left.

IMPORTANT TIP #1:  It is strongly recommended that you view the 
Config Notes for each configuration before making any changes to 
that configuration; just click the "Config Notes" button to display 
them in your default text editor (probably Notepad).

Select an item in the listbox by clicking on it. This will show the 
possible choices for that item in the panel on the right. 

IMPORTANT TIP #2:  Hover the mouse pointer over the radio button 
groupbox or the various edit boxes or checkboxes to see useful pop-up 
hints about the items. 

Edit boxes will usually have a default value shown to the right as well 
as the current setting for the parameter if any. Checkbox defaults are 
shown below the checkboxes.

Select a radio button, check/uncheck checkboxes or change the contents 
of the edit boxes to suit your desires for each entry. Then click the 
Apply button to apply any changes to the entry's panel contents.

You will see error messages if the configuration is invalid, or if the 
expected files are missing. The situation needs to be corrected before 
the program can be used to change the associated settings. 

The configuration files can be edited with a text editor; see the 
ModifierNotes.txt file for details.  Instructions are included to help 
you make your own custom configuration files if you wish.


*******************************************************************

                   Mod Compatibility Warning:

Some mods have their own custom screens and configuration files.  You 
should take care not to replace the custom mod's files with ones from 
the ZRP.

There are different kinds of entries, FileChoice, Field and LineToggle. 
Only one of these types can cause conflicts with mods:  FileChoice.
As of version 1.1 alpha r3, the potentially-dangerous file copy entries 
are indicated by a red warning above the FileChoice radio-button group.

It is recommended to make FileChoice changes before installing other 
mods.  This should be done outside of Smart Mod Manager, if you use it. 
To do this, extract the ZRP directory from the archive, the run the 
Modifier program in the gamedata directory there to make your changes.  
Then install the modified ZRP with SMM and follow with the other mods.

It is okay to modify entries afterward if they do not have the warning 
text on the entry's page.  The SMM program changes files when it merges 
them, and this might cause the Modifier program to complain.  Follow 
the advice in the previous paragraph if necessary, or don't use SMM.

You can merge these optional files with other mods beforehand.  View 
the *.cfg file in a text editor to see what files are copied.  Then 
compare the related files with the corresponding files in other mods.

==================================================
The APPLY button:

When done with the panel changes, click the Apply button. Changes are 
NOT applied until you do so! Currently, if you select a new item in the 
listbox without clicking Apply, any changes will be abandoned -- even 
if you select the same item. 

The REVERT button: 

When the Apply button is first clicked for a setting, the original 
files if they exist are copied to "filenames.ext.orig_bkup", so that 
you can revert to the original file if you want by clicking on the 
Revert button. NOTE: This original file is never overwritten, so 
reverting will always copy the original unmodified file back. 

The revert process will show a status pop-up of what was copied or not 
copied. 

The DEFAULT button: 

Currently, this button only appears on panels with fields (edit boxes) 
and checkboxes.  It allows you to restore the vanilla values as shown 
to the right of the edit boxes, or the default shown for checkboxes. 
You will need to click the Apply button to accept the changes. 

The HELP button will show this file, while the ABOUT button will show 
info about the program.
