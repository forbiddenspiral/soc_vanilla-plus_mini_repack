 File: Vanilla.cfg 

This particular configuration group can be used to restore 
vanilla characteristics to most of the ZRP mod.

For the most vanilla experience, repeat these instructions 
for each entry in the list box:

	Select an entry.
	Click the Default button.
	Click the Apply button.

The defaults for each entry in the Vanilla configuration are 
preset to the original values. Clicking the Default button 
restores these vanilla settings, and clicking the Apply 
button then changes the game files.

One set of exceptions are the FileChoice entries, described 
below. There is no default for FileChoice options, so you 
will need to select the "Vanilla" or the "Do not enable" 
choices.

For the Trade and Search Screens entry, select 
"Vanilla Screens (10x6x2)" and click the Apply button 
to revert to the vanilla screen settings.

For Extra Level Changer, select the "Do not add level 
changers" choice and click Apply.

The extra level changers are new shortcut pathways that open 
up to you once you have completed a certain amount of 
progress in the game. You might want to trek the long way 
around at all times.

Note that increasing the body stay time for NPCs and mutants 
may require a new game. The ZRP value is four hours, the 
vanilla default is 36. 

Hover the mouse pointer over the edit boxes, radio buttons 
and checkboxes to see pop-up tips on the use of the selected 
item. 

While most changes can be applied to a game in progress, 
changed settings may not affect existing tasks and secrets. 
For example, task delays for existing tasks won't change, 
nor will the contents of secrets already given.

Some of these entries can be found in other Modifier .cfg 
configuration files, although their defaults are more likely 
to reflect the ZRP settings rather than the vanilla ones.

At any time you can use the Modifier to put back features 
that you might wish to try.

===========================================================

The ZRP is a complex bug-fix patch/mod, with many changes 
not found in vanilla.  While the vast majority are bug fixes, 
some changes are enhancements meant to improve the player's 
personal experience with the game.

Some features of the ZRP were legacy: when the first version 
was released, there was no free play option, so a late-game 
weapon (normally only available once you were past the point 
of no return) was added to a secret. (This and other weapons 
are no longer default in the latest ZRP releases; see the 
ZRP Legacy entries in the _ZRP configuration.)

Some features are convenient, like the ability to start a 
new game and jump into the story at any point in the game, 
or even to the end of the story (AKA "free play").  Or one 
can jump across a level with the quick-travel feature.

Other ZRP default conveniences are the inclusion of the level 
abbreviation on secrets and the notification when you have 
emptied a stash.  You can also reject certain side tasks if 
you do not want to do them, and view the rewards offered. 
In vanilla, you will not be able to get to a later task if 
you don't do the current one offered.

Despite the fact that one can view the credits after the end 
of the normal game (or at any time, really) via a main menu 
button, some were upset that the final cutscene didn't 
immediately go to the credits.

While most like the ability to continue playing, the ZRP is 
about having the experience one wishes.  To that end, this 
configuration file can recreate the purest vanilla experience 
for those who want it while still retaining the ZRP bug fixes.
