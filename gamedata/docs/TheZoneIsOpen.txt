	The Zone Is Open -- You Can Start Anywhere

ZRP version 1.07 sports features that should prove extremely valuable to:

	Modders
	Folks upgrading from 1.0 to 1.0004 or later
	Folks afflicted with a game-stopping bug
	Folks desiring a new experience in the basic game

Now you can equip yourself for any major point in the game and get all the 
objectives for that point. You can optionally jump to the associated level 
from the Cordon.* You can also quickly jump to level changers on each level, 
or special custom locations that you define. 

For the "free play" option:  Give yourself all the objectives for the Final 
Level (or Free Play) at any time, and then enjoy the game with no pending 
objectives.

Version 1.07 also permits starting with just a knife.  See the Free Play 
Tweaks entry of the Tweaks Modifier configuration.  You can also edit 
_dev.script and set add_nothing to true if you wish to avoid the Modifier.

This is an on-going work, but you can get an idea of what is possible. You 
can now continue playing after you finish the game, even if you did not start 
a new game.  If you start and finish with this version, you will be prompted 
to change levels after the "good" cutscene, so you can continue play. (You 
can also start a new game, select the "Final Level or Free Play" option and 
then jump to the final level, which will permit you to continue play after 
you finish the game.) 

If you are already running with STALKER patched to 1.0004 or later, you do NOT 
need to start a new game for the equipping feature and the intra-level jump 
feature, but you will need to start a new game to use the new Cordon teleports 
level jump feature. You can also continue play after the final level without 
starting a new game, although the convenient return teleport is missing; you 
will have to go back the way you came.

This means that if you want to see the credits, you will need to select the 
Credits button from the main menu.

Please note that you can still start the free play option at any time without 
starting a new game. 

***********************************************************
ALWAYS make a named save (ESC S is good) before doing any of the following, as 
it changes the game!
***********************************************************

The ability to select a chapter in the STALKER SoC story (even changing to 
the corresponding level from the Cordon) and the ability to jump to select 
spots within each level are features added in version 1.05, with dialogs to 
support them. These dialogs are available from the main menu.

Changing to any level can only be done while on the Cordon (Escape) level.  
But you can do this at any time in the game while visiting that level.


======================================
PART 1:  EQUIPPING and CHANGING LEVELS
======================================

To equip Marked One for a certain point of progress (PoP) in the game, press 

	ESC T

(If you are already on the main menu in an active game, just press T.)

You will see the dialog (graciously provided by TSL16b) for equipping and 
teleporting to a new level.  If you are not on the Cordon level in this 
version, the "Equip only" checkbox will be checked already.

You can then select an entry in the list, or press the key corresponding to 
that point of progress:

	G - Garbage
	A - Agroprom
	U - Agroprom Underground
	B - Bar, post Agroprom
	D - Dark Valley
	8 - Lab X18
	C - Cordon from Dark Valley, post X18
	W - Wild Territory
	Y - Yantar
	6 - Lab X16
	L - Yantar Lower Level (Tunnels), post X16
	M - Military Warehouses
	R - Red Forest
	9 or 0 - Lab X19, AKA Brain Scorcher
	P - Pripyat
	N - Chernobyl NPP
	S - Chernobyl NPP Sarcophagus
	H - Monolith Control Center
	F - Final level or free play (all storyline objectives completed)

Depending on the checkbox selections, this will a) give you the "keys", 
objectives and needed objects for the start of any of those locations, and/or 
b) change levels to the selected location. It is safe to repeat the selections 
or select them out of order, but the results might be unpredictable. 

The checkbox options allow you to equip yourself for a PoP without traveling
there, or just change levels without changing your PoP.

Each PoP is based on the normal progression in the game, as indicated by the 
order of selection list above.  You can customize the loadout you receive; see 
the "Under the Covers" section below.

***********************************************************
NOTE:  While this works on some setups without problems, there may be 
conflicts with key assignments.  There are several possible workarounds:

You can use the mouse to perform the action instead of the hotkey.
You can edit the _dev.script file to fix this to suit your needs.
You can change your key assignment.  (This is listed only for completeness.)
***********************************************************

After you have acquired the desired PoP settings, you should examine your 
inventory and make adjustments ("Lock and load") as needed.  For example, 
you might want to put the scope and grenade launcher on the rifle, or select 
a different primary weapon, as well as equip your belt.

In later levels this is necessary because you will need to choose what to 
drop, as you will likely be overloaded if you don't modify your carrying 
capacity. 

Except for the Cordon jump, you will be prompted if you want to change levels. 
Selecting yes will load the new level.  Selecting No will put you at the north 
end of the Cordon.  (You can press ESC J S to get back to Sid's office.)

Please note that you can mix and match.  You can give yourself the PoP for Red 
Forest, but jump to the Bar instead.

In some cases while trying to change levels, you might have to repeat the 
sequence if you didn't trigger the level changer's hit box collision 
detection. 


========================================
PART 2:  JUMPING to spots inside a level
========================================

To jump to another level changer or custom location on a level, press

	ESC J

(If you are already on the main menu in an active game, just press J.)

You can select one of the various set points on the level to jump to it. 
Generally, the defaults are the level changer "reject" spots (where you would 
wind up if you said "No" to the question "Move to next level?" 

Custom locations are in the _custom_zrp.script file which is not installed by 
default; see the "Under the Covers" section for details. 


===============
Free Play Stuff
===============

A "free play" treat is in store if you use the "Final Level or Free Play" PoP 
and then jump to the Garbage or one of the other levels.

As a natural result, there will be a mass migration of NPCs and mutants in 
some cases. You might want to quickly jump to a different location and let the 
creatures get to their destinations before returning. Some additional 
polishing may still be needed; please report any unusual issues you encounter. 

The game has a bit of a different flavor with characters assuming new roles 
in new locations...

The passphrase is "There is no spoon."


================
Under the Covers
================

This stuff is supported by the following files in gamedata\scripts\:

_z.script
ui_main_menu.script
ui_teleport_dialog.script
ui_level_zip_dialog.script
_dev.script
optional\_custom_zrp.script  <== must be copied to gamedata\scripts\ for use

Note that some of these files in turn depend on other files, like those in 
gamedata\config\ui.

Additional changes were made to all.spawn files and other config files to 
support the new level changers and to modify triggers for free play. You do 
not need the all.spawn for the "Part 2" intra-level jumps.

The file _custom_zrp.script is the place to make changes to the special jump 
points within a level, and to change the loadouts, which you can edit to 
change your preferred loadout. You can give yourself whatever custom equipment 
you desire; see the use_my_special_loadout variable and the 
add_my_special_loadout() function.

SPECIAL NOTE: Copy _custom_zrp.script from the gamedata\scripts\optional
subdirectory to gamedata\scripts\ for use.  This will permit you to keep your 
custom settings even if you install a newer version of the ZRP.

You can output some position and direction info suitable for use with the 
custom jump locations by pressing P (for position) while at the main menu
in a live game.  This information is sent to your console/log file.  It also 
adds a temporary entry to your Jump dialog.  Required: _custom_zrp.script 
copied from the scripts\optional directory to scripts\.

Take care with the info_portions.  You should not modify them unless you are 
very familiar with them.

There are new level changers added to the files alife_l01_escape.ltx and 
alife_l12_stancia_2.ltx, found in the decompiled all.spawn.  This makes the 
Cordon level a bit heavier; some tweaking of your texture quality might be 
useful if you are close to the resource edge on that level.

Modders and others:  If you repeatedly find yourself starting a new game, 
you should rename gamedata\config\scripts\esc_trader.ltx.no_Sid_talk to 
esc_trader.ltx to skip Sid's opening monologue, and use the -nointro command 
line parameter on the shortcut you use to launch STALKER to skip the movie.

*Requires new game. But hey, you can duplicate your existing game, pretty 
much.
