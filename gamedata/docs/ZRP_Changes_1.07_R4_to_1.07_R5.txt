  [config\gameplay\info_l01escape.xml,
  config\text\eng\stable_storyline_info_sarcofag.xml,
  _g.script, death_manager.script, gulag_dark_valley.script, 
  gulag_general.script, gulag_pripyat.script, 
  se_respawn.script, se_stalker.script, smart_terrain.script, 
  smart_terrain_params.script, state_mgr_animation.script, 
  task_manager.script, treasure_manager.script, 
  ui_wpn_params.script, xr_box.script, xr_danger.script, 
  xr_logic.script, xr_motivator.script, xr_gulag.script, 
  xr_heli_hunter.script, optional\*\xr_*.script]
* PDA aesthetic display formatting changes. (MrSeyker)
  [config\ui\encyclopedia.xml, encyclopedia_item.xml, 
  news.xml, pda_character.xml, pda_contacts_new.xml, 
  pda_dialog_character.xml, pda_dialog_character_16.xml, 
  pda_events.xml (can select only top third of last line in 
  full list at left in encyclopedia, so vanilla is an option), 
  stalkers_ranking.xml, stalkers_ranking_character.xml, 
  stalkers_ranking_character_16.xml, talk.xml]
* Added a few seconds of delay to the dog attack on Fox.
  [config\misc\gulag_escape.ltx]

  [config\scripts\optional\esc_trader.ltx]

  [bind_stalker.script, optional\*\bind_stalker.script]
* Enhanced Shaggy cell space restrictor processing to permit 
  him to get back inside if spawn jitter puts him outside his 
  cell before rescue. A small chance remains that he will 
  spawn outside the factory -- he can get back but it is 
  possible he'll die of bandit causes if online. See also 
  all.spawn changes. [xr_conditions.script]
* Used selective logic on Skull's group and the Freedom/Duty 
  fighters in Red Forest. Once they reach camp, a save/reload 
  should not put them back at the start of their locations.
  [config\misc\gulag_mil_dolg.ltx, gulag_radar.ltx]
* Inserted an aesthetic delay before Pripyat loner's "Go!".

  chimera, fracture (izlom), zombie. They are not yet tweaked 
  for damages to them or from them. The burer is one-hit 
  lethal, for example. See ZRP Support Utilities Changes.
  [config\creatures\m_*.ltx, config\ui\ui_npc_monster.xml,
  config\models\capture\chimera_captures.ltx, _g.script, 
  xr_statistic.script]
* Restricted a Freedom secret to the Freedom faction.
  [config\misc\treasure_manager.ltx]
* Removed the non-vanilla ZRP legacy weapons from secrets. 
  See the Modifier changes to restore them if desired.
  [config\misc\treasure_manager.ltx]
* A feeble attempt was made to further improve the sound 
  management timings. [sound_theme.script, xr_sound.script]
* More unused resource removal. [dialogs_military.script, 
  gulag_bar.script, xr_conditions.script]


All.spawn changes/fixes since R5EE (requires new game):
* Reduced chance of encountering Poker before you could get 
  the task to deal with him. [alife_l04_darkvalley.ltx]
* Delayed a couple of bandit spawns; val_lager_bandits doesn't 
  have enough jobs initially and the out-of-work bandits were 
  not following any camp rules. [alife_l04_darkvalley.ltx]
* Tweaked Shaggy cell space restrictor logic to better support 
  spawn jitter hack. [alife_l04_darkvalley.ltx]
* Added inventory box max_count to inventory boxes that 
  kept filling up as replacement NPCs arrived. Repurposed one 
  WT box to make it actually useful; original ST went offline 
  before it could be used.
  [alife_l04_darkvalley.ltx, alife_l06_rostok.ltx]
* Restored inventory box max_count to mil_bandit (mercs at 
  homestead). [alife_l07_military.ltx]
* Made Freedom patrol leader look at player at entrance to 
  Army Warehouses. [alife_l07_military.ltx]
* Removed unsupported silencer flags from vanilla AK74S and 
  AK74SU spawns. [alife_l07_military.ltx]
* Removed the misused state checks for mil_lager, which can 
  autocomplete the Lukash autoquest to defend the campsite 
  from the mercs if there are no bloodsuckers in the village. 
  [alife_l07_military.ltx]
* Removed grenade launcher and silencer flags from NPP Obokan 
  (AN-94 Abakan) spawn; vanilla weapon doesn't support them.
  [alife_l12_stancia.ltx]
* Corrected typos ("wawe"->"wave").
  [way_l07_military.ltx]


See the diffs\ subdirectory's *.diff files for details.


Modifier configuration changes (MrSeyker and NatVac):
* Some UI options have been updated. 
  [config\ui\*.xml, modcfg\_ZRP.cfg]
* Made "Create Save for First Level Access Post Progress" 
  default for autosaves. [modcfg\_ZRP.cfg, bind_stalker.script]
* Added option to enable "Kill the Stalker from Monolith" task.
  [modcfg\_ZRP.cfg]
* Added option to enable the ability of NPCs to upgrade to 
  rifles if they have sawn-offs. [modcfg\Experimental_AI.cfg]
* Added ability to adjust the amount of bleeding reduction 
  provided by medkits. [modcfg\Tweaks.cfg]
* Added note that Rulix "NPCs reload early" may crash if NPC 
  dies while reloading if you are using patch 1.0006.
  [modcfg\Experimental_AI.cfg]
* Added option to disable/enable new progress-based level 
  changers. [modcfg\Vanilla.cfg, scripts\optional\zlc.script]
* Added the options to restore a couple of vanilla bugs:
  Remove the ability to find high-end artifacts on NPCs, and 
  make the game forget that you searched a body when you 
  change levels, so you can have more chances at secrets if 
  any are still available. [modcfg\Vanilla.cfg]
* Added option to enable/disable night music.
  [modcfg\_ZRP.cfg, config\optional\game_levels_music.ltx]
* Moved Shadow State's skippable Sidorovich intro to new 
  option. [config\scripts\optional\esc_trader.ltx.*, 
  modcfg\_ZRP.cfg]
* Added npc/mutant spawn utility installation as part of the
  Spawn Tools entry. [modcfg\SupportUtilities.cfg]
* Adjusted MonoMartyr config file to accommodate changes in 
  the spawning script. [modcfg\MonoMartyr.cfg]
* Added switch repair utility installation as part of the 
  Fix Broken Doors/Switches group. Fix X16/X19 switches if 
  needed. [modcfg\SupportUtilities.cfg]
* Added Mark by CLSID utility. [modcfg\SupportUtilities.cfg]
* Provided the ability to individually re-add the ZRP legacy 
  weapons to certain secrets. [modcfg\_ZRP.cfg]


Debug changes (NatVac):
* Added functions to support body management:
  move_body_to() - Move bodies to locations you recorded.
  punt() - Toss bodies away from you.
  dispose() - Move bodies into whirlygig and vortex anomalies 
  if the level supports them. MAKE A HARD SAVE FIRST! (A hard  
  save is any save made from the main menu.)
  pull() - Complement to push(), good for bodies out of reach
  move_body_to_nearest_lc() - use with pull() to place 
  permabodies near level exits. move_body_to() might be 
  more practical here; see z.script file for details.
  [z.script]
* Added crash protection to the unload_and_detach_addons() 
  function. [zx.script]

ZRP Support Utilities Changes (NatVac):
* New spawn utility: Spawn Entities: NPCs and Mutants.
  [optional\z_spawn_entities.script]
* New repair utility: Repair X16/X19 Switches.
  [optional\z_repair_level_switches.script]
* Logging of script execution calls is now optional, 
  not default. [ui_zrp_utils_dialog.script]
* New marking utility: Mark by CLSID.
  [optional\z_mark_by_CLSID.script]
* New informational utility: Hunter Bloodsucker Lair Task Info. 
  It demonstrates access to the task_manager innards, telling 
  you when the task is available and if a bloodsucker target 
  is present. Requires a manual install: just copy it up a 
  directory. [optional\z_hunter_bloodsucker_task.script]

  bind_stalker.script, scripts\optional\*\bind_stalker.script, 
  config\scripts\agr\agr_knockdown.ltx]
* Tweaked Rulix weapon manager's update_weapon(). (castl)
  [scripts\optional\ai_rx\rx_wmgr.script]

  default. (Also see Modifier changes) [xr_box.script]

  (They may not.) [config\gameplay\character_desc_pripyat.xml]
* Reduced game tutorial width for 1.0006 compatibility.
  [config\ui\game_tutorials.xml, string_table_tutorial.xml]
* Fixed Fanatic's merc attack behavior when you refuse to help. 
  You can no longer get the task later. Fanatic/rookies prepare 
  for attack either way. [config\gameplay\dialogs_escape.xml, 
  gulag_escape.script, xr_effects.script]

  can now choose rifles if available and they have rifle ammo.
  [config\weapons\w_bm16.ltx, config\weapons\optional\w_bm16.*]

  underground markers, moved map a bit south on global map. 
  With this change, all task and secret stash markers are 
  visible on PDA maps. Removed mipmaps as well.
  [config\game_maps_single.ltx, textures\map\map_agroprom.dds]
* Removed mipmaps from map_aes_1.dds and map_aes_2.dds.
  [textures\map\map_aes_*.dds]
* Added pre-fill function to treasure_manager.script, removed

  (MrSeyker, NatVac) [config\ui\*.xml]

  [_dev.script]

  [_dev.script]

  delete the file.) [levels\l12_stancia\level.snd_static]
* Assigned location story_id instead of object story_id 
  to Skinflint/Murk village bloodsucker task. It was possible 
  to complete Voronin's RG6 task before bloodsucker task, so 
  old task marker would erroneously show Duty base as target.
  Requires new game to be visible, acts as vanilla otherwise.
  [config\gameplay\tasks_military.xml, see all.spawn changes]
* Supplied an invisible image file for hiding that flashing 
  disk I/O icon at the lower right of the HUD. (See Modifier 
  changes.) [textures\ui\ui_disk_io.dds.invisible]

  [scripts\optional\ai_rx\rx_wmgr.script]

  optional global ammo drop adjustment. 
  [death_manager.script, deleted optional\*\death_manager.*]
* Optimized proceed() and process_info_portion() code.
  [bar_dialogs.script, level_tasks.script, *_tasks.script]
* Tweak to support stealth a bit better: If your enemy didn't 
  identify any enemy before they die, they now take that lack 
  of knowledge with them to the grave in the save. (If they 
  have identified an enemy, you're hosed just as before.) 
  [xr_death.script, xr_effects.script]
* Optional but recommended: New system.ltx files don't load 
  some unused resources like multiplayer support, scripts and 
  dialogs for unused levels, info_portions and the like. 
  [config\optional\system.ltx.*]


All.spawn changes/fixes since R4 (requires new game):
* Locked out an overlapping camp spot at the exit to the 
  Garbage. [way_l01_escape.ltx]
* Assigned unused Mil_Controller story_id to space_restrictor 
  for new Skinflint/Murk village bloodsucker task marker.
  [alife_l07_military.ltx]

See the diffs\ subdirectory's *.diff files for details.


Modifier configuration changes (MrSeyker and NatVac):
* Adjusted Alt1 actor.ltx crouch/low-crouch accuracy settings.
  [config\creatures\optional\actor.ltx.alt1]
* Updated Actor.cfg and FirstPersonShooter.cfg and their 
  corresponding config notes. [modcfg\*.cfg, *.cfg.txt]
* Added option to enable/disable rain sound fix when changing 
  levels or loading previous save. [modcfg\Experimental.cfg]
* Surprise boxes can be enabled and the odds of a surprise 
  adjusted. [modcfg\ArtifactSwap.cfg and .cfg.txt]

  binoculars. [modcfg\_ZRP.cfg]
* You can adjust the healing properties of items per lowenz.
  [modcfg\Tweaks.cfg, Tweaks.cfg.txt]
* Added/changed SupportUtilities.cfg functionality.
  Replaced "Force Possible Secret" with "Secret Script Stuff".
  You can now populate all the secret stashes. This will 
  introduce more lag until the stashes are cleared.
  [modcfg\SupportUtilities.cfg]
* Extended Freedom vs Duty configuration with optional faction 
  relationship adjustments for player (e.g. Freedom player can 
  be neutral with the scientists). 
  [Freedom Vs. Duty.cfg, .cfg.txt]
* You can toggle a background texture for the HUD time display.
  [modcfg\_ZRP.cfg] (Obsolete optional files removed.)
* Removed death_manager.script copying to support unified 
  approach. [modcfg\ExperimentalAI.cfg]
* Added entry to hide/unhide that flashing disk I/O icon at the 
  lower right of the HUD. [modcfg\Tweaks.cfg, Tweaks.cfg.txt]
* Unique weapons can now be dropped in pristine condition when 
  NPC dies. [modcfg\_ZRP.cfg]
  


Debug changes (NatVac):
* Fixed crash when attempting to bump a body lacking a physics shell.
  (reported by belizarius) [zx.script]
