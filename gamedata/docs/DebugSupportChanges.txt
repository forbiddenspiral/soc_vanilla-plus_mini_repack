===================
Debug support enhancements and changes:
===================
This document defines the shortcut keys that you can use in the 
game to perform various tricks and debug operations, like speed 
up/slow down game time, or remotely search bodies.

These require debug support enabled in _z.script. This can be 
done by editing the file or using the Modifier's Debug Options 
entry to check "Enable ZRP Debug Features". Note: Some minor 
spoilers below. 

The menu must be showing (that's the Esc part of the key 
sequences) with the game in progress and Marked One must still be 
alive. The particular keystrokes that follow Esc can be changed 
manually to suit your purposes. 

WARNING: Sometimes the use of the "jump" sequences can put you 
in a very bad place. It is possible to break a game in progress 
if you teleport to a location out of sequence. Or you can simply 
die because your destination puts you in bad company. You should 
make a quicksave before using these sequences. 

Also, many of these commands will result in information being 
output to the console log and subsequently to the log file. 
You'll see "! Unknown command: " followed by "dbg:_" and the 
information printed to the console.  This info is benign.

===================
New in 1.07 R3:  Macro support.  Almost any key on the keyboard 
can be used to execute a command or sequence of commands from 
the main menu while playing the game.  You can add your own, or 
change the key mapping for certain functions currently mapped 
to F2, F3, or F4, or override other function assignments (e.g., 
use Esc P to do something other than record position info).

These macro sequences are kept in _custom_zrp.script.  The file 
can be found in the scripts\optional\ subdirectory.  If you 
already have a customized copy in scripts\ you might need to 
copy the macro tables from the optional file.  If you don't 
have this file in scripts\, you will need to copy it up a 
directory from scripts\optional\.  This is done so that 
installing a ZRP update won't overwrite any custom keys or 
intralevel jumps you have defined.

Note that Esc P is considered a predefined macro stored in 
zx.script, but you can define your own macro assigned to 
DIK_keys.DIK_P in _custom_zrp.script.  It will be processed 
instead.  Study the macros table in that file for examples 
of what you can do.

You might want to set ui_main_menu.script's use_quit_hotkey to 
false to avoid accidentally quitting when trying to execute a 
macro that uses a hotkey near the letter "Q".

Debug support is now split between _z.script and zx.script.  
The zx.script file contains the macro support and some routines 
that are not critical to playing the game, like the "jump to 
bodies" or "remote grab" functions.  The game will function 
just fine without this file, although some debug functions 
will no longer work.

===================
Debug data commands:

Esc D Esc -- Display on-screen debug info

Esc D Esc puts the display of positional debug info on the HUD 
and returns to the game. The display now supports additional info 
relating to the closest game vertex, useful for all.spawn entries. 
This is a toggle; if the debug info is present, Esc D removes it 
and returns directly to the game.

Esc P -- Record console and log position info

A snapshot of the current position info can be written to the 
console (and therefore the log file) via Esc P. If you have 
installed the _custom_zrp.script file, this snapshot can be used 
to return to the recorded position while you are still alive on 
the same level. Make the return jump via the Esc J Fn key 
sequence, where Fn is the function key (F1-F12) assigned in order 
according to the number of times you pressed Esc P during that 
level session. So the fifth Esc P is assigned to F5.

The console log contains this info in a manner that can be copied 
to the _custom_zrp.script file to make it a permanent jump 
destination, although care must be taken to keep the braces and 
parentheses matched, and the key shortcuts should be changed.

This command provides the necessary info for position, vertex 
IDs, direction, and dest_direction for most all.spawn objects 
like level changers, etc.

Esc CapsLock -- toggle statistics

When enabled via the Modifier "Debug Options" entry, Esc CapsLock 
toggles the display of the rs_stats debug statistics information 
on the game screen. The CapsLock key is easily changed in 
_z.script if you prefer to use a different key.

This is the same as typing "rs_stats on" or "rs_stats off" in the 
console -- except it is faster.

Esc D X -- toggle NPC/mutant damage reporting

This toggles the debug info on showing NPC and mutant damage when 
you hurt them.  It works for the current session only.  If you 
wish to make it always on, change show_hit_damage to true in 
xr_motivator.script.

Esc D D -- No operation

Press D to return to the game if you accidentally press Esc D. So 
Esc D D does nothing. 


===================
Debug movement commands:

Esc D R -- return to previous position

After any ONE of these Esc D movement commands, you can return to 
your original position by pressing Esc D R.  Only the last 
position is remembered.  See also Esc P.

Esc D F -- teleport FORWARD a little bit

Esc D F in most cases will teleport you straight ahead 2 meters. 
This can be convenient to get around NPCs that block your way, 
or extricate yourself if you find that you are stuck when you 
reload a saved game.

It can be used to fix the Cordon trader's door if it breaks. 
Just teleport inside his office, then push the inert door open. 
You can then block it open, or continue to use Esc D F. (NOTE: 
a better solution, an actual fix that reattaches the missing 
door scheme, is supplied as one of the ZSU utilities.)

If you are in Dark Valley near Shaggy's jail cell door or near 
the entrance to X18, this key sequence will permit you to advance 
the game in the event the Dark Valley door switches are broken. 
(They also do this even if the switches are not broken.) Again, 
save your game beforehand -- and try the ZSU script to repair 
broken doors first.

This Esc D F sequence now also records your current position even 
if you don't install the optional support for the intra-level 
jumps (Esc J). Again, use Esc D R to return to the last recorded 
snapshot. Since this is overwritten every time you use Esc D F 
(and the other jump commands listed below), you should install 
the optional _custom_zrp.script file before starting the game, 
and then record a specific location in game via Esc P as a 
precaution for your first jump. Otherwise, your option may be 
limited to the level start or even just the level exit 
(Sarcophagus). 

(The _custom_zrp.script file is optional to prevent future ZRP 
installs from overwriting your custom changes. See the file 
TheZoneIsOpen.txt in the gamedata\docs subdirectory.) 

Esc D <n> -- teleport UP

Esc D followed by a number from 1 through 9 will teleport you 
forward 2 meters, and move you straight up 5 times that number of 
meters, plus three more. So Esc D 1 jumps up 8 meters (and ahead 
2 meters), Esc D 2 jumps up 13 meters, Esc D 3 corresponds to 18 
meters, etc., through Esc D 9 which will put you up 48 meters. 
You are moved ahead 2 meters to put you on a rooftop or inside a 
building if needed; otherwise you'd just fall back down. Rapid 
successive repeats of this command sequence can put you up even 
higher, if you want to test the impact protection of your 
invulnerability artifact. 

TIP: You can turn on the distance indicator for your cursor to 
determine the number of meters you need to rise to get to the 
roof of a building. 

Esc D 0 -- teleport UP a little bit

Esc D 0 will move you up only 6 meters, which may be useful for 
jumping up one floor if Esc D 1 is too much. 

Esc D - -- teleport DOWN

Esc D - (hyphen) will drop you below your current location.  This 
can be useful for dropping below the level to see if any items 
(e.g., artifacts) spawned from breaking crates fell out of the 
level. (Remember Esc D R to return to your previous position, one 
level only.  Save first!)

Esc D W -- jump to wounded

Esc D W teleports you to the nearest wounded guy (good or bad; 
maybe this should be changed) within 150 meters of your current 
position, or reports "No wounded". 

Esc D B -- jump to nearest unsearched body

Esc D B (think "dead body") will teleport you to the nearest 
unsearched body within 150 meters. This is useful when you want 
to search a body on the rooftop of the building in Pripyat, and 
not the body of the snork or Electro victim around the corner. 

This command will place you at the foot of the body and orients 
you toward the head of the body.  You'll need to look down each 
time you use this command; the function to set the player's 
direction resets the vertical view angle.

Esc D A -- jump to any unsearched body

Esc D A (think "all" or "any") will teleport you to a random dead 
body on the level that you have not yet searched. DO NOT USE THIS 
when you have not yet completed the main storyline tasks for the 
level, because it can mess up the game's progression, and 
possibly trigger events that expect other triggers to have 
occurred already. Also note that some bodies spawn dead on a 
level at certain points (e.g., the Dark Valley trenchcoated 
bandit on the upper floor of the factory above X18) and even 
respawn over and over (certain bodies are created anew each time 
you come near X19 in Red Forest after switching off the 
Scorcher). 

This is intended to permit searching those bodies that fly 
across the level due to the physics collision-detection bug.


These jumps each make a snapshot of the current position only if 
there is an unsearched or wounded body available. Even if you are 
on a rooftop and try to jump to the next body but there isn't any 
unsearched, you can still press Esc D R to return to the previous 
position. However, if you encounter two bad places in a row, you 
will have to use the jump menu to extricate yourself if you did 
not record a position snapshot with Esc P. 

Jumping to a body will orient your direction to face the head of 
the body after placing you at the position of the "feet" (where 
the game marks the location of the NPC).  This can be useful in 
determining which body you've jumped to.

WARNINGs: Some wounded and bodies are in bad places, like Electro 
anomalies. Wear suitable protection and expect bad things nearby, 
like pseudodogs, snorks or enemy NPCs. The jump will put you at 
the feet of the target body, and that might be in a place where 
you can fall out of the level -- immediately press Esc D R to 
return to your starting point. Some bodies are already out of the 
level, but you can use this feature to search the body and then 
use Esc D R to get back to the normal game.  See also Esc D Home.

Esc D R or Esc D \ -- return to last recorded position

Esc D R or Esc D \ will return you to your last position prior to 
the jump performed by the last Esc D [A|B|F|W|0-9], if that sequence 
went somewhere.  If the jump fails (e.g., no more unsearched), your 
current position doesn't overwrite any existing snapshot.

===================
Debug collection commands:

Esc D G -- get loose items ahead of you

Esc D G (think "debug get") will acquire any loose artifact 
("af_*") or weapon ("wpn_*") or grenade ("grenade_*") directly in 
front within 75 meters, one per execution. This works through 
walls or ground. Exception: The item must be online; 
Electro-based artifacts Moonlight, Flash, and Sparkler are only 
online between midnight and 5 AM.  

NOTE: There's some quirk in the game that requires you actually 
move in the direction of your target; merely spinning around and 
looking the right way won't work. TIP: put the spot of your 
target straight up on the minimap, then move toward it a bit 
before using this command.

Esc D C -- collect loose items around you

Esc D C (think "debug collect") will acquire ALL artifacts, 
weapons, grenades, ammo, and outfits within 10 meters, even 
through walls or out of the ground. You can grab the X18 rocket 
launcher this way if it is below the surface, or the Storming 
Obokan if it is somewhere nearby but you are not sure (make sure 
it isn't in Agroprom underground; go by the marker). WARNING: 
This will grab stuff you might not want to grab, like the weapons 
in Skinflint's office. 

Esc D / -- store all loose weapons on bodies

Esc D / will locate all loose non-unique (*_m1, *_m2, *_m3 
weapons are unique) online weapons and move each to the corpse 
nearest it. You will see a notice of loose guns stored, or loose 
guns found and stored if not all found are non-unique or there 
are no dead bodies available. A news item about each unique 
weapon found will be displayed.

The console will contain the weapon identifier and the name and 
location of the destination body for each weapon moved.

This command executes in a pair of nested loops, an outer loop 
over all the objects to identify the online loose weapons, with 
an inner loop to find the closest body to each storeable weapon. 
It may take a few seconds to execute.

This command is recommended if you don't use the "store weapons 
in backpack" option, in order to keep your framerate up -- if 
you aren't already collecting the dropped weapons for sale.

The target bodies are marked unsearched in case you wish to 
jump to them. 

Esc D Home

If you can't reach the next unsearched body without triggering 
the "Move to next level?" prompt or falling out of the level 
or getting fried in an anomaly, press Esc D Home. This will 
"search" the nearest body (which might net you a secret) and 
then transfer all the NPC's goods to your inventory. 

Nothing wasted. --Unless you drink the vodka when there's no 
radioactivity around. :P

While you can use this command to fetch the inventory of the 
hapless dude caught up in a whirligig, be aware that the game 
will crash if the dude is obliterated at just the same instant 
the inventory is being checked. 

===================
Debug creation/destruction commands:

Esc D K - kill controllers

Esc D K (think "debug kill kontroller") will kill any living 
controllers on the current level. This is a cheat provided to 
avoid the "dBodyStateValide(b)" CTD caused by a bad controller 
animation, usually because it is being attacked by a pack of 
dogs. 

Esc D Delete - remove anomalies

Esc D Delete will convert the closest anomaly within 10 meters 
directly ahead to offline status, if it is one of the four 
supported types: Whirligig, Springboard, Electro, and Burnt Fuzz 
(not tested for Burnt Fuzz), the same as those avoided by stalkers 
via SANB. For this to work, however, you must "delete" an anomaly 
(you'll see a news message), save, and then reload. 

NOTE: While this has had a fair amount of testing, one should 
make a named savegame prior to deleting an anomaly, just in case. 

Esc D L -- add extra level changers

Esc D L will add the new free-play level changers if they have 
not already been added.  You can execute this command at any 
time; only the level changers appropriate for the current level 
of progress will be added if they are not already in the game.
Currently this command is automatically executed when you 
complete the normal game, but it is safe to repeatedly execute 
it as you go.  (Yes, the plan is to automate this.)

Esc D N or Esc D End - nuke the weapons

You can use Esc D N to destroy any non-unique weapons in the 
inventory of the nearest body (or the second nearest, if it is 
the last one you searched) within 3 meters, and get the same 
credit as you would get from a trader.

Back story:  The Ziphty guys have agreed to pay you to "clean 
up the zone" of weapons that compete with what they want to 
sell.  Just pour acid over the moving parts to claim a credit 
(radioed to you) of up to 20% of the gun's cost, depending on 
its condition.

Yes, it's a cheat to save you the grief of transporting the 
guns back to a trader.  You can lower the reimbursement fee or 
comment out the DIK_N block in _z.script if it offends you. 
(Weigh in with your vote at the GSC forum site.)

===================
Debug time commands:

You can now vary the game's clock speed.  This does not change 
the speed at which events happen; it just speeds up or slows 
down the game's clock.

However, that does have an effect on events.  Quests will time 
out sooner if you speed up the clock.  Quests might terminate 
early if the target lairs or entities change day/night states.

If you slow down time, be aware that the Esc S quick save game 
feature uses the game clock for the name of the save.  Since 
you are be limited to only one quick named save per game minute 
(default is six real-time seconds per game minute at 10X), the 
last save in any game minute will overwrite any previous quick 
named saves, similar to the normal quicksave overwriting the 
previous quicksave.

There are two types of time adjustments, absolute and relative. 

Esc D <numpad-n> -- absolute time rate adjustment

Absolute changes set the time to fixed powers of ten times 
real time. Use Esc D keypad-n (where n=0 to 4) to set the game 
clock to 1X, 10X (system default), 100X, 1000X, and 10000X real 
time.  The formula is:

    game_time_rate = real_time * 10^n

	Esc D <numpad-0> -- game time is the same as real time
	Esc D <numpad-1> -- game time is ten times faster than real
	Esc D <numpad-2> -- game time is one hundred times faster
	Esc D <numpad-3> -- game time is one thousand times faster
	Esc D <numpad-4> -- game time is ten thousand times faster

The advantage to this approach is that you can save games with 
different time speeds, and always be able to reset the game 
clock to the default of 10X via Esc D numpad-1.

Esc D numpad-* and Esc D numpad-/ -- relative time rate setting

The time can also be adjusted relative to the current setting, 
either multiplying it by a factor of 10 (Esc D keypad-*) or 
dividing it by ten (1/10X, Esc D keypad-/).  Think of it as 
moving a gear shift lever on a bicycle up a notch or down a 
notch.  The min/max values would still be 1X realtime/10000X
realtime.

Esc D numpad-Enter

Esc D numpad-Enter either gets the current setting if it has 
not already been set/checked in the current game session (since 
the last savegame load or level change), or it restores the 
clock speed that was present at the start of the session.

Note that you can watch the time change on the HUD clock if you 
wish to use this as a method of skipping the dark of nighttime. 
Just press Esc when you near the desired time, followed D and 
the number or symbol corresponding to the time speed you want.

===================
Other cheats and shortcuts:

Esc F1 -- Antirad hotkey. (Not debug.)

Esc F2 -- Shortcut for dropping a medkit if you are within three 
meters of a stalker that has less than 80 points of health. It 
will trigger the "drop-a-medkit" transfer if so. (You can make a 
friend if his health is less than 71%.) Otherwise no medkit will 
be dropped and you will see a note about the health of anyone in 
front of you. 

Esc F3 -- Combination of jump-to-wounded and drop-a-medkit.  This 
is useful if the wounded guy is in a level changer.

Esc F4 -- Combination of jump-to-unsearched-body and destroy 
weapons.

Esc F5 and Esc F6 -- Named quicksave commands. (Not debug.)

===================
Debug miscellaneous commands:

Esc D Space

This sequence bumps bodies and boxes around the player (default 
10-meter radius).  If any are invisible because a portion of mesh 
intersects with the ground, they will become visible at least 
briefly as they are pushed into the air.

Small metal cases are likely to break after going airborne.

Esc D H

Look at a stalker and set the direction by moving a bit toward 
him.  Then press Esc D H to find out his health.  This works on 
enemies as well as neutrals and friends, so you can check if your 
shots have been having any effect.

A reminder:  You can drop a medkit to heal the nearest stalker 
within three meters whose health is below 80%.  On master 
difficulty, a medkit will heal 60 points of health.

Esc D M

There is also Esc D M to mark MonoMartyr bodies. Use with 
caution; if used right after a MonoMartyr has been killed by an 
anomaly but before the body is destroyed by the anomaly, this 
will likely crash the game. 


===================
Notes:

The deprecated debug support to remove the faulty Yantar 
helicopters has been removed. 

The Esc D Z command to spawn an item into the game has been 
superseded by a couple of ZRP Support Utility (ZSU) functions.

The Esc Tab sequence to toggle the rs_stats command has been 
changed to Esc CapsLock, as the Alt-Tab key combination in the 
menu was conflicting with the original sequence. 

The direction algorithm no longer identifies stuff that is 
directly behind you as well as in front.

The deprecated Esc D I ("Identify artifact") command has been 
removed, since it was used for obtaining info on unreachable 
NPCs which no longer exist.  Again, see Esc D Home.

See the ZSU's Execute Script Command for more debug commands 
(e.g., teleport to level locations by position or distance).
