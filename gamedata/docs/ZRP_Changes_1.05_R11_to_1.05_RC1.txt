**********************************
Details of changes and fixes since the 090429 demo release:
**********************************

The location markers are now completely managed to the best of 
our current knowledge, thanks to Mr. Fusion. Let us know if you 
find any that persist when they shouldn't. Note that some 
grey-circle tip markers are more persistent than before, but they 
will also go away under certain logical conditions like visiting 
the stash or progressing in the game. (research and primary 
clean-up scripting: Mr. Fusion) 

The Red Forest antenna farm and Pripyat hotel tasks have been 
tweaked to reveal markers as you go, helping reduce confusion. 
(Mr. Fusion) 

Box and crate spawns are greatly improved: Electro-based 
artifacts are always visible. Stuff doesn't fall through the 
floor -- if the box/crate is one you broke; some entities will 
remotely break containers and still cause trouble. The 
dual/multi-core delayed spawns of items from these containers may 
be fixed, as well. Old behavior can be restored, and there is a 
third option: Just directly spawn the contents in your inventory, 
with a news item listing the stuff. (NatVac) 

You can now enter free play after the "good" (extended) ending 
even if you didn't start a new game. See docs\TheZoneIsOpen.txt 
for details. (NatVac) 

The ironsight zoom of the Storming Obokan/Abakan has been 
corrected. (NatVac) 

The Enter key now works on the Save Game (saves game if filename 
supplied) and Load Game (returns to main menu) dialogs. At the 
main menu, it activates the currently-highlighted button. 
(NatVac) 

More English typos corrected. (Mr. Fusion: tasks, general, 
NatVac: TM, weapons, dialogs, general) 

X16 and X18 task hints have been added to support the now-visible 
underground markers. (Mr. Fusion) 

Ivantsov is no longer quirky about repair. (Mr. Fusion) 

The AW Skinflint/Murk bloodsucker task reward exploit has been 
removed. (Mr. Fusion) 

The "Kill the Monolith Stalker" autoquest is deferred to the time 
when the target is expected to be online. (NatVac) 

The Chernobyl NPP map should now show the player's position, by 
using a separate map (textures\map\map_aes_2.dds) in 
config\game_maps_single.ltx for stancia2 (NPP North Side) with 
full transparency for the lower half. However, this is dependent 
on the order in which the two AES maps load, so the complete fix 
might be to make map_aes_1.dds transparent in the upper half. 
(NatVac) 

Some Modifier configuration files were updated. See the Tweaks 
configuration for modifying some alife.ltx parameters, and see 
the "New Game Tweaks" entry on the _ZRP configuration to define a 
save game prefix. This prefix can be changed at any time outside 
of the game; you don't have to start a new game. (NatVac) 

Note: The 090429 release of the demo had accidentally included 
the se_monster.script from Mr. Fusion's Live Stalker Ranking as 
default. It is an option, but if you are not using it, you can 
remove the file if you wish. If you are using this feature or 
would like to use it, see the "Live Stalker Ranking" entry in the 
Experimental configuration for Mr. Fusion's latest version. 


**********************************
Widescreen changes (may need tweaking): 
**********************************

af_params_16.xml: Changed ui_icons_newPDA_showpers_e to 
ui_inv_icon_chemical_burn_immunity for 
static_chemical_burn_immunity. (Kosmokrator) 

inventory_item_16.xml: Lengthened the item description text area 
to suit improved inventory_new_16.xml. (NatVac) 

inventory_new_16.xml: Improvements to make better use of 
available area, swapped shock and impact on item description. 
(090206 fix by nandersen, NatVac on top of Raw's work) 

ui_custom_msgs.xml: Commented out the HUD clock background. It 
seems that it is not adjusted for widescreen as the rest of the 
HUD is. You can tweak it further by editing the coordinates for 
the main_time_static entry. (NatVac) 


**********************************
TZIO fixes (NatVac): 
**********************************

The Cordon railroad bridge soldiers are not automatically ticked 
off enough to fire at you if you select a point of progress. 

Certain Agroprom underground events (e.g., the explosion) should 
not happen if you have the appropriate progress via TZIO. 

You have to visit the Cordon after completing the game before the 
MonoMartyrs can make an appearance, unless you enable their early 
appearance via the Modifier. 

Please note that the new level changers are not automatically 
added via TZIO in this release (unless you are in the right 
place).  You have to either add them via Esc D L (see below) 
or go through the final teleporter and get the final cutscene 
to add them automatically.


**********************************
Debug Support changes (NatVac): 
**********************************

Several new commands have been added, and several existing 
commands have been changed. There have been some algorithm 
improvements in direction finding and searching. Some combo 
commands have been added for convenience. 

Esc D L can be used at any time to add the new level changers 
(automatically added at the completion of the normal game), but 
the mechanism has been tweaked to permit only those level 
changers suitable to the current point of progress. 

Spoilers:  New level changers will be added automatically at 
certain points:  When you get the Agroprom military case, the 
X18 documents, and the X16 documents.  You can execute this 
debug command after reaching the NPP for a way back to Pripyat. 
The Sarcophagus-to-NPP LC is not available until you make it 
through the normal game ending in order to remove the blowout 
timer and ground radiation.

Please see docs\DebugSupportChanges.txt for more debug details. 


**********************************
Tweaks:
**********************************

The tushkanos are now more resistant to electricity, since many 
of them tend to start life -- and end it -- in a tunnel filled 
with Electro anomalies. (NatVac per Mr. Fusion) 

The Save Game dialog can have a default filename prefix, to make 
savegame organization easier. (NatVac) 

You now have the ability to make an alternate quicksave via Esc 
F6 (or Esc F5). This creates a level-specific "snapshot" similar 
to the Esc S named save, but it will overwrite itself for that 
level. The saves have the form "<prefix><level_name>_snapshot" 
except for the first time it is executed on a level, in which 
case the name is "<prefix><level_name> - start". (NatVac) 

There is a certain rare chance that some boxes that would 
otherwise only yield a bandage (1 in 333), or medkit or antirad 
or Fort pistol (1 in 1000), will now offer a very rare artifact 
(1 in 1000 for each of the all-good ones). Because it will be a 
rare game when you get anything from these boxes anyway, this may 
need tweaking. --Or not. (NatVac) 

Some stalkers will let you approach with gun out to within 4 
meters before complaining. (Reminder: You can turn off the 
whining; see the "Sound Annoyances 2" entry in the Modifier.) 
This is a minor change, affecting mainly generic stalkers. Quite 
a few are still pre-programmed to be upset at 10 meters. (NatVac) 

The grey circle marking the Garbage vehicle graveyard is smaller 
to permit the viewing of a secret there, important because the 
Garbage grey markers persist for quite a bit longer. (NatVac) 

There's now a text message for Seriy to accompany the "dead meat" 
announcement. (Mr. Fusion) 

Barkeep mention of Duty HQ access now requires separate 
acknowledgement. (NatVac) 

The crazy stalker's flash now yields a "Found PDA" journal entry 
instead of a Diary entry. Several Army Warehouses tasks (from 
Skull, Murk/Skinflint, Max) now have task article references 
instead of diary entries. (Mr. Fusion) 

Delayed "Assist at Freedom's Barrier outpost" rush until you 
acknowledge Cap's request, per BobBQ. Before, the timer started 
when you initiated the dialog; now it waits until you have had a 
chance to read the text (and possibly trade with him). (NatVac) 

The notice to heed the call of the monolith is moved to after the 
X-19 cutscene. (NatVac) 

Since the HUD clock background was commented out to keep it from 
looking ugly in widescreen, the original ui_custom_msgs.xml file 
was moved to ui\optional\ui_custom_msgs.xml.clock_bkgnd. You can 
replace the update with the older file if you prefer the clock 
background on your standard (4x3) display monitor. (NatVac) 

The new level changers are selectively added as you achieve 
certain points of progress in the game (not yet via TZIO unless 
you are on the levels where the LCs are normally added). Due to 
the blowout, the late game level changers (NPP to Pripyat, 
Sarcophagus to NPP) are added when you finish the normal game, 
but you can manually add the "NPP to Pripyat" LC when you arrive 
at the NPP via Esc D L. (NatVac) 


=====================================
Changes in 090429 demo release over ZRP 1.05 R11 090206:

* Some vanilla files tweaked to get past SMM filtering.
* Red75's Stalkers Are Not Blind no longer uses odds.
  (Should be better in non-combat situations.)
* Explosives now correctly labeled, internationalizable. 
  (romulous)

ZRP 1.05 R11 All.spawn changes:
* Rare vanilla Agroprom waypoint CTD fixed.

Modifier changes:
* Time of day toggle in Experimental.cfg.
* You can now enable the MonoMartyrs early, before completing 
the game.


=====================================
Changes in R11 090206 release over ZRP 1.05 R10:
=====================================
Tweaks and typo corrections based on Don Reba's LTX syntax 
checker have been incorporated. 

Raw's widescreen inventory gets an update. (nandersen)

Duty gets equal time with Freedom: Captain Ivantsov can also 
repair weapons and armor, just like Screw, if the option is 
enabled. However, Captain Ivantsov is moody in this release. If 
he doesn't offer the opportunity for repair, keep trying. (NatVac 
implementation of a BobBQ solution to a motiv-8 recommendation.)

The MonoMartyrs seek revenge. This requires that you either 
complete the normal game with the "good" ending, or enable free 
play AND go through the last cutscene. You can do this by 
teleporting to the final level, north of the NPP) using Esc T F 
and then jumping to the Cordon exit via Esc J C. Please see 
MonoMartyr.cfg.txt (the MonoMartyr.cfg Config Notes for the 
Modifier program) for more details.  (NatVac, fatrap for the 
strangers idea, future enhancements by nandersen, others)

A few anomalies are removed in free play mode to support better 
NPC existence. Just load a save from the final level and get the 
cutscene. Or you can start a new game, use Esc T F to teleport to 
the final level, then use Esc J C to get the final cutscene and 
the message "The Zone is Open". You can add to the anomaly 
removal list, and you can also remove anomalies directly while in 
the game, although in that case you'll need to save/reload for 
the change to take effect. (NatVac, from bardak's acdc.pl, IG2007 
comments, and a couple of Ru Team lines of code.)

You can swap good artifacts for better ones with Skinflint; you 
might want to keep him alive for now. Bring lots of every kind of 
artifact, and LOTS of money.  There's a storage box nearby under 
the stairs.  (NatVac, with a form of barin's uber-artifact)

The Wild Territory (Rostok) minimap is fixed.  The helicopter 
fires on that level are removed after something happens in 
Yantar. The chopper still glows, though. (NatVac)

The Monolith and the zombied have been commanded to collect any 
valuable artifacts they find, and the ones from Red Forest onward 
have about a one percent chance of having found one or more. And 
when the Scorcher drops, the military aren't above picking up 
what they find (one percent), and of course the loners along with 
the Duty and Freedom guys really ransack the place. (This last 
change is due to a fix correcting the odds calculation in a 
vanilla script, a bug found by Alex-Tommy. Blame NatVac for the 
rest.)

Note:  Odds are aggregate.  The odds of finding a particular 
good artifact on an NPC in Red Forest and beyond are 1 in 200 
for loners, Duty, Freedom and mercs, and 1 in 1000 for Monolith, 
zombies and military.

The same script fix was applied to boxes. In vanilla, anything 
with a chance lower than 10 in 1000 (<1%) was rounded to a zero 
percent chance. This includes your nice stuff like weapons (e.g., 
FN F2000 had a 0.3% chance in dungeon boxes) and many the top end 
artifacts. For example, Night Star, Goldfish, Moonlight, Urchin, 
Mica, and Crystal each had a 0.9% chance in generic boxes in the 
Bar and levels west and north of the Bar, but you'd never get 
them at all in vanilla. (NatVac)

You can revisit the NPP levels for continued exploration after 
completing the game with the good ending.  The ground radiation 
and the blowout are removed.

In this mod, the Monolith attacking the barrier don't run out 
of 9x39 ammo if they have VLAs (AS Vals).  The Monolith and 
northern zombies are usually equipped with AP ammo.

Many debug enhancements and changes. See the corresponding 
document, mentioned below. 


=====================================
Fixed as of ZRP 1.05 test release 10 (includes other ZRP fixes):
=====================================
This is not exhaustive.  See ZRP_Changes_1.0_to_1.05_R10.txt.

Stalkers no longer die in campfires when switched online. 
(bardak, et alia) 

Quests complete the way they are supposed to. (bardak, with minor 
fixes by others) 

No more empty secret stashes. (bardak) 

Tushkanos are treated as the vermin they are by the NPCs. 
(Russian forum fix by way of fatrap) 

Fanatic's Cordon rookies hide before the Mercenary attack, not 
after. (bardak) 

Typos in all.spawn kept things from working. (Alex-Tommy, barin, 
Cpt. Borovich, dezodor, Don Reba, EggChen, fatrap, NatVac, omero, 
others...) 

Tuskanos no longer beep. (NatVac) 

Tushkano encyclopedia entry is fixed. (NatVac per Mr. Fusion) 

Your reputation doesn't swing wildly between excellent and 
terrible. (NatVac) 

You can heal stalkers that were wounded without "Gimme a medkit" 
dialogs, or worse, would otherwise crash the game. Just drop a 
medkit nearby. You get the exact same benefit (friendship with 
neutrals, reputation credit) as if you had healed him via dialog. 
You must be within two meters of the spot (usually based on the 
feet), and it is momentarily disabled for stalkers that first 
require healing via dialog (e.g., Tolik, Fox). (NatVac) 

You can no longer engage in trade with a wounded stalker. (XiaNi) 

You can complete the Strelok quest. (NatVac) 

Lights don't shine out of the ground during the day. (NatVac) 

Possible crash when killing Yurik's robbers at Garbage entry 
(copy/paste bug) fixed. (NatVac per Alex-Tommy) 

Exiting the way you entered the Agroprom tunnels now immediately 
completes the "Find your way out of the underground" objective. 
(NatVac) 

Rostok HUD minimap works correctly. (NatVac, fatrap) 

You can go by the tracks in Rostok to save Kruglov without 
getting the flyby cutscene later. (NatVac) 

You can complete the Lukash mission to kill Skull's group even if 
you save and reload in the middle of the battle. (bardak, NatVac) 

If Skull dies when you are working on the "kill the sniper" 
mission, the mission fails (instead of sticking around 
unfinished). (NatVac) 

Army Warehouses Merc camp waypoint no longer causes a crash. 
(NatVac) 

Returning to AW from Red Forest no longer causes a crash if you 
didn't defend the border from the Monolith. (NatVac)

Most typos in the dialogs and secrets have been fixed, including 
misleading references to "cellar". (And some of the secrets are 
now worth reading.) (NatVac)

Marked One's position while underground should now match reality 
in the PDA. Sometimes, you'll see secrets and tasks marked 
correctly there as well. (NatVac)

Icons for impact and shock protection in inventory suit 
statistics are swapped to match other uses like artifact stats. 
(NatVac; done just knowing someone else had already done it) 

You have a chance of finding better artifacts on the bodies of 
loners, Dutyers, Freedomers and others in Red Forest and points 
north.  Config files had this, but script support was broken. 
(Alex-Tommy)

You now have a real chance of getting rare items in crates later 
in the game. The ph_box_items_*.ltx files had items that had odds 
of less than 10 in 1000, but the script truncated anything below 
1 in 100 to zero chance. (NatVac)

Fire-protection "battery" is correctly marked "Shell" (NatVac)

Ecologist's mutant parts quests are fixed. (fatrap, NatVac, 
Decane)

Fixed Sniper TRS301 (Sniper ZM LR-300ML) zoom, as it was using 
ironsight zoom instead of SUSAT scope zoom. (NatVac)

Removing your items from a stash no longer prevents its possible 
use as a future secret stash. (NatVac)

Again:  This list is not yet exhaustive.

===================
Requires new game with r11 all.spawn (versus r10):
===================

Fox and Guide are not bothered by the dogs from the first attack 
once you kill them. Also, the smart terrain for the dogs (located 
right in the house) is disabled once you handle the threat. 
(NatVac)

The R11 all.spawn RC3 is included. Changes over RC1:
* Rare Agroprom military base waypoint crash fixed. (NatVac)
* NW Garbage hangar guard is moved a bit so you can walk up the 
stairs. (BobBQ) 


===================
Other Features:
===================
The Zone Is Open (TZIO) permits one to pick up the game at any 
chapter in the story, even after the story ends (aka "free 
play"). (NatVac, awesome teleport dialogs by TSL16b) 

You can also jump instantly to various points on each level.  
Please see the file TheZoneIsOpen.txt in docs\ZRP_docs.

The Modifier program for configuring STALKER to your liking. A 
new version of the program is included. It now has a mod 
compatibility warning about the FileChoice options, and it 
supports an additional Alias keyword for Fields. There are a few 
more configuration options. 


===================
Known issues:
===================
Release-specific:

The Tab key to show the current task might show the previous task 
instead, late in the game or after you complete the normal game. 

I've noticed slightly more "fugue" state NPCs than normal in a 
couple of camps. Save/reload should fix them, although they just 
seem to be lost in thought and you can still talk to some. It may 
have to do with a bad transition from handling a threat to 
returning to "kamp" mode. 

Twice during playtesting, I've encountered a situation where I 
couldn't select any inventory during the searching of bodies. 
Saving and reloading fixed this.  Tossing my weapon also fixed it. 


General:

A couple of stalkers can mess up a eliminate-the-camp quest by 
joining the camp while they are held offline. An example: Poker 
can become part of the Rostok bandits if you don't go to Dark 
Valley first, but he is not switched online until you deal with 
Borov. 

See the following files in the gamedata\docs subdirectory for 
much more information:

CrashesStillInTheGame.txt
QuirksInTheGame.txt
DebugSupportChanges.txt (lots of new features)

A reminder:  "! Unknown command:  dbg:_" followed by text in your 
console log is just a debug statement.  Look at it to know what 
it is about.  Usually it is just informative, as when guns are 
moved into bodies or crates are broken (with crate debug mode) 
or a mapspot removal is deferred.

Please report any new issues on the forum sites mentioned in the 
ZRP readme file.
