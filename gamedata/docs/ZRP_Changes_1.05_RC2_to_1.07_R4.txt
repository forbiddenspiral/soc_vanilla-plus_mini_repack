=====================================
Changes in 1.07 R4 over ZRP 1.07 R3
=====================================
ZRP 1.07 R4 changes (NatVac and others as noted):
* Fixed uncommon Lukash dialog branch CTD.
  [config\gameplay\dialogs_military.xml]
* Enabled nighttime ambient music, starts after midnight.
  [config\game_levels_music.ltx]
* Sleeping NPCs now turn off headlamps. (ZaGaR)
  [sr_light.script]
* Removed references to unused kishka, deadcity gulags.
  (Also see R3 change in config\misc\gulag_tasks.ltx.)
  [xr_gulag.script]
* Added 'select' conditional section support to gulag jobs. 
  This generally fixes Nimble's post-merc-attack desire to 
  return to the site of captivity; just save/reload after 
  the battle otherwise. [config\misc\gulag_escape.ltx, 
  xr_gulag.script, xr_logic.script]
* Veteran bandits are now allowed in the Garbage gulags.
  [config\misc\smart_terrain_presets.ltx]
* Minor tweaks to logic, part of ongoing process. Example: 
  Bes looks across vehicle graveyard instead of at you when 
  telling his team to take their positions.
  [config\misc\gulag_garbage.ltx et alia]
* Sakharov's task to find special suit no longer available 
  until after X18, prevents futile attempt until "that psi 
  protection" is accessible. [config\misc\task_manager.ltx]
* Trade files have been updated to reduce/eliminate trade 
  exploits. (MrSeyker) [config\misc\trade_*.ltx, 
  config\misc\optional\trade_*.ltx]
* Fixed binoc animation, FN F2000 silencer icon, 3rd-person 
  knife view with jrmy's data. (MrSeyker, jrmy)
  [config\weapons\*.ltx, config\weapons\optional\*.ltx]
* Updated default and real weapon names. It was a lot of 
  work. Good job! (MrSeyker) [In config\text\eng\optional, 
  stable_storyline_info_military..xml.(real_gun_names,zrp),
  string_table_enc_weapons.xml.(real_gun_names,zrp),
  string_table_tasks_bar.xml.(real_gun_names,zrp)]
* Added keybinding choices for first/third-person view.
  (MrSeyker) [config\ui\ui_keybinding.xml]
* Some additional script resource optimizations, better 
  string management. [various; mainly gulag_*.script]
* Certain important scripts are now pre-loaded. 
  [_g.script, _z.script, modules.script, xr_*.script]
* Removed some unusable tasks. [config\gameplay\tasks_*.xml, 
  config\gameplay\game_tasks.xml]
* Tweaked sound theme stuff a bit. Good weather also used 
  idle camp remarks, but weather theme timing had made NPCs 
  chatterboxes. [sound_theme.script]
* Fixed Hunter's bio reference.
  [config\gameplay\character_desc_bar.xml]
* Added extra X16 objective to reduce confusion.
  [gameplay\tasks_yantar.xml]
* Stopped post-X19 replacement antenna farm monolith from 
  suiciding. [gulag_radar.script]
* Added in-your-face fatal config error dialog as in-game 
  warning was not enough for some. This prevents the creation 
  of bad mismatched-version saves due to custom system.ltx.
  [already in _dev.script, made zrp_notice.script default]
* Zombies should no longer panic at grenades.
  [xr_danger.script]
* Reworked camp logic:
    1. NPCs can no longer get the same spots in any camps. 
    However, some camp spots still share a common destination 
    vertex or the vertex is not accessible. Some camp spots 
    with a shared or invalid vertex are already pruned. 
    (Some camps will need a new game start for complete fix.) 
    An extra camp in bar has been activated to guarantee 
    capacity not exceeded for pruned Bar camps.
    Please report any camps needing attention.
    2. Stalled NPCs should snap out of their zone fugue. 
  [xr_kamp.script, gulag_*.script, config\misc\gulag_*.ltx]
* You can no longer buy binoculars from NPCs per Decane.
  [config\misc\trade_generic.ltx]
* Implemented workaround for xrGame.dll bug that runs 
  overweight tutorial in psi emission field per Decane.
  [_g.script]
* Tweaked task manager to better handle 'find' tasks if 
  found but not present during dialog with task giver. Issue 
  reported by Decane et alia. [task_manager.script]
* Tweaked bolt's force_grow_speed; secondary throw charges 
  seven times faster. (Decane) [config\weapons\w_bolt.ltx]
* Mark Duty HQ, not Voronin, in Kitsenko dialog per Decane.
  [bar_dialogs.script]
* Fixed wrong auto-completion of some autoquests like "Defend 
  the stalkers at the campsite". [gulag_general.script, 
  xr_gulag.script]
* Reworked Barkeep storyline dialog so that X18 uses same 
  start/gain/done checks as X16 and X19, fixed id="11". 
  [_dev.script, config\gameplay\dialogs_bar.xml]
* TZIO: Added Cordon blockpost case to list to add if needed. 
  (Not likely, but original removed if task marked as done.)
  [_dev.script]
* Replaced broken Agroprom soldier path reported by castl.
  [config\misc\gulag_agroprom.ltx; see also all.spawn]
* Added newline to Pripyat loner squad logic. (castl)
  [gulag_pripyat.script]
* Added isWeapon() support for RG6. (castl) [_g.script]
* Fixed Pripyat Monolith worshippers not going aggro when 
  hurt. [gulag_pripyat.script]
* Fixed Dark Valley watchtower guards and sniper shooting the 
  Duty sacrifice victim early. [gulag_dark_valley.script]
* Removed one more Pripyat Electro anomaly for free play.
  [_z.script]
* Attempted fix of time display for wide-screen players.
  [config\ui\ui_custom_msgs.xml]
* More formatting tweaks of inventory display. (experimental) 
  [af_params*.xml, inventory_new*.xml in config\ui\]
* Extended anim control to include Options dialog.
  [scripts\ui_mm_opt_main.script]
* Disabled Rostok helicopter fires after a certain point of 
  progress. [_z.script]
* Added four more named autosaves as option; see Modifier 
  changes below. [bind_stalker.script]
* Modified debug coordinates display, added options; see 
  Modifier changes below. [_z.script]
* Returned lightly-wounded weapon action to "strapped".
  [state_lib.script; see also Vanilla.cfg Modifier changes]
* Stopped psi-emission intensity doubling on save/reload, 
  automatically cures stuck psi-field effect on save/reload. 
  [sr_psy_antenna.script]
* Removed Red Forest "sleep room" psi-emission bug/exploit.
  [sr_psy_antenna.script]
* Merged ZRP script changes into corresponding files in 
  ai_rx\, grenadier\ and ZRP\ under script\optional\.
  [bind_stalker.script, modules.script, xr_kamp.script, 
  xr_logic.script, corresponding add-on files]

  [alife_l06_rostok.ltx, alive_l08u_brainlab.ltx]
* Replaced broken Agroprom soldier path reported by castl.
  [gulag_agroprom.ltx, way_l03_agroprom.ltx]
* Surviving Kruglov-attack mercs either don't go offline or 
  don't join ANY quest target camps before they do.
  [alife_l06_rostok.ltx]
* Gave Kruglov/Semenov something to play with in the bunker. 
  [way_l08_yantar.ltx]
* Removed limit from merc resupply chest in north farmstead. 
  [alife_l07_military.ltx]
* Changed Red Forest Monolith and military respawners from 
  medium frequency to often. [alife_l10_radar.ltx]

  in config\weapons\optional\]

  Groza/Tunder 5.45 if conditions are right.
  [scripts\optional\z_give_sidorovich_groza_m1.script, 
  modcfg\SupportUtilities.cfg]
* New Debug Options. [modcfg\_ZRP.cfg]

Debug changes (NatVac):
* Changed use of db.actor:direction() to device().cam_dir,
  from comment by smoq2. This eliminates need to move a bit 
  in the desired direction -- just look there.  [_z.script, 
  z.script, zx.script, z_spawn_item.script]
* zx.heal_if_needed() still reports NPC health if you have no 
  standard medkits. [zx.script]
* Added view angle (up/down) support to debug direction. This 
  is useful for level changers. (Esc P, Esc D) 
  [_z.script, zx.script]
* Adjusted Esc D debug display position and information.

  grenades. [_z.script, z_spawn_item_in_inventory.script,
  z_mark_by_partial_name.script, z_variable_watch.script]

  readability. Just remember that they are hard spaces.
  [_g.script's dbglog() function; see z.print_table()]

  example.

=====================================
Changes in 1.07 XR1 over ZRP 1.05 RC2a Update 100331
=====================================
Optional Mini-Mod (Demo) changes (NatVac):
* The demo features must be enabled for use in this version. 
  You can use the Modifier -- see these configurations: 
  ArtifactSwap, MonoMartyr and QuestOverhaul_2.  Note that if 
  you are using an existing save based on earlier MM/AS/1.05 RC 
  demos, the old QO weapon versions are already in the game so 
  the new ones will not be added.
* The Lukash sniper rifle mission is now a bit harder; you have 
  to be able to enter the Duty base to get to it and stealing 
  it can have foreseeable consequences.
* The reward for the modified grenade launcher is an improved 
  version of the modified VLA/AS-Val: It uses a higher-power 
  scope that you must find somewhere in the game.
* Fedeyin's Folly explosion protection increased a bit.
* Ziphty artifact health regen reduced.
* Odds of finding random grenades (bodies/boxes) cut 80%.

ZRP 1.07 XR1 fixes (NatVac; others mentioned in situ):
* Added support for killing all the bloodsuckers before talking 
  to Murk about doing that, which should prevent a possible
  dialog CTD. [config\gameplay\dialogs_military.xml]
* Disabled two more anomalies for free play (one killed too 
  many Pripyat Freedomers). [_z.script]
* Tweaked white diamond objective marker to be upward-pointing 
  triangle (the target is above you). [config\ui\ui_common.xml]
* Enabled previously-optional CTD protection to prevent CTDs 
  from deaths of badly-constructed entities due to mods or 
  games based on older patches. [smart_terrain.script]
* Respawn Population Management 1.0: Changed Alife replacement 
  script to reduce respawn flooding. [se_respawn.script]
* NPC Chatter Control to manage the over-the-top repetition by 
  various NPCs. [config\misc\script_sound.ltx, xr_sound.script, 
  sound_theme.script]
* Added TZIO "Follow your instincts" task as a workaround for 
  empty task list crash when updating "eliminate camp" tasks. 
  [ui_st_other.xml, tasks_escape.xml, info_portions.xml, 
  bind_stalker.script, storyline_info_taskmanager.xml]
* Added missing l10u_bunker reference (Brain Scorcher bunker) 
  to map file per Cpt. Borovich, then tweaked it to hide the 
  underground level.  [config\game_maps_single.ltx]
* Other minor fixes by Cpt. Borovich, like having the newly- 
  dead fall with respect to the one who killed them if not 
  you. [various; search for Cpt. Borovich]
* You can now return to a previous position after an Esc J
  jump via debug's Esc D R (or via Last Snapshot Position on 
  Jump menu w/_custom_zrp.script). [ui_level_zip_dialog.script]
* The DV half-dead bandit doesn't repeat his Bullet spiel when 
  he switches back online.
* Gave PSZ-7 outfit its own support, per Storm Shadow State and 
  ZaGar. [config\text\eng\string_table_outfit.xml,
  config\misc\outfit.ltx, textures\ui\ui_icon_equipment.dds]
* Reverted to 1.0003-compatible state_lib.script, removing 
  unused test stuff put into ZRP 1.05. [state_lib.script]
* Partial consolidation of weapon/armor/etc. configuration text 
  entries into corresponding XML files. [config\text\eng\*.xml]
* Other minor TZIO/free play enhancements. You won't get the 
  psy helmet or the decoder if past the places where they are 
  needed.  You can open that door without the decoder if in 
  free play mode.

All.spawn changes since R11 RC3 (NatVac - requires new game):
* Moved/adjusted level changers at WT/Bar interchange for a 
  cleaner appearance in PDA.
* Added "Change level?" prompt to Pripyat-to-NPP level changer.
* Adjusted Agroprom-to-Garbage destination view downward a bit.
* Moved Pripyat-to-Red-Forest destination east of wall segment
  to provide a bit of cover if there are any Monolith there.
  (Spawning in the midst of a bunch of Monolith is still silly.)
* Tweaked three Dark Valley NPCs to no longer require an online 
  escort to make their way to their new camps.
* Tweaked Cordon TZIO level changers to reduce the possibility 
  of teleporting when running and jumping over a bush. They 
  also now put you west of the rookie camp when you say no. 
  You can return to previous position with debug mode Esc D R.
  Also combined and moved the TZIO LC objects to the bunker 
  file for easier merging, and included them in a separate 
  document to assist in this.
* Moved west Garbage hangar guard position to permit stairs 
  access.  May need more tweaking; position might be ignored.
* Automatic cleanup of certain dead dogs in Cordon and the 
  Bar as you progress through the normal game.
* The Duty Bar hangar guard stops telling you to get out after 
  you complete a certain task for the faction.
* Tweaked NPP helicopter activity for post-game support.
* Adjusted free play return point, for a bit of novelty.
* Provided a couple of types of ammo to Shaggy and the DV
  sacrifice victim.

Debug changes (NatVac):
* Esc D / no longer stores expended but unexploded RPG 
  missiles. [_z.script]
* Esc D N now gives a little credit for MonoMartyr weaponry.
  [_z.script]
* Esc D Space (bump) now gracefully handles the rare unbumpable 
  backpack embedded in the ground, left over from a partially-
  removed body. [_z.script]

Modifier changes (NatVac):
* Fixed Modifier install for Set Info_portion script; was the 
  same as that for the Reset script.  Reported by romulous.
  [SupportUtilities.cfg]
* Added new respawner configuration. [RespawnerControl.cfg]
* Actor configuration has new Difficulty sections. [Actor.cfg]
* Split Artifact Swap configuration off from MonoMartyr one.
  [ArtifactSwap.cfg, MonoMartyr.cfg]
* Tweaks configuration has a new TZIO option to spawn with 
  only a knife. [Tweaks.cfg]

ZRP Support Utilities Changes (NatVac):
These changes require the re-installation of the associated 
script entries: Give Yourself Money and Execute Script Command. 
If you have edited your scripts, be sure to back them up and 
merge the changes.
* Protection from bad data for go(), improved functionality for
  number_online(). [z.script]
* Give Yourself Money now processes expressions. 
  [z_give_yourself_money.script]
* New utility:  Variable Watch.  Add an expression to see the 
  result on-screen 5 times a second. [z_variable_watch.script, 
  _z.script]
* New utility: Remove Pripyat Anomalies disables some of the 
  anomalies normally hidden when free play is achieved, to 
  improve NPC activity in Pripyat before going to the NPP.
  [z_remove_pripyat_anomalies.script]
  
* See also Modifier changes for corrected configuration, and 
  reread the docs\ZSU_ExecuteLuaCommand.txt file for updates.

=====================================
Changes in 100331 RC2a Update over ZRP 1.05 RC2 release 091230
=====================================
ZRP 1.05 RC2a Update 100331 changes:
* Added more debug functions: Bump bodies/boxes (Esc D Space),
  toggle show_hit_damage (Esc D X). [_z.script]
* Added tests to prevent corrupt game saves due to incompatible 
  mods (forces early crash; useful error message). [_z.script]
* Added Storm Shadow State's tweak: you can talk to Sidorovich 
  during game start monologue. [config\scripts\esc_trader.ltx]
* Extended show_hit_damage to include mutants when enabled.
  [bind_monster.script]
* Added telepathic psi emitter damage (versus rupture) per
  ZaGaR. Optional; see Modifier changes. [sr_psy_antenna.script]
* Added NPC faction-based color coding to PDA statistics.
  [config\text\eng\stable_statistic_caption.xml]
* Yantar/AW LCs now automatically appear after after a certain 
  Army Warehouses task. [mil_tasks.script]
* Task manager tweaks.  Script now uses forced exits if bad 
  conditions encountered (exit would occur anyway but later). 
  Configuration file's DV bloodsucker task had unneeded 
  condition. [task_manager.script, config\misc\task_manager.ltx]

ZRP 1.05 RC2a Update 100331 fixes (NatVac; others in situ):
* The permanent radiation bug is automatically fixed after a 
  save/reload. [bind_stalker.script]
* A possible load game crash fixed if you managed to save right 
  after being punched. (barin, w/NatVac tweak)
  [bind_stalker.script, xr_effects.script]
* Storm Shadow State's fix allows being near Fanatic with your 
  weapon safely equipped. [config\misc\gulag_escape.ltx]
* Yurik conversation options don't just disappear if you don't 
  ask in the right order. Reported by romulous.
  [config\gameplay\dialogs_garbage.xml]
* If Kruglov stalls in Rostok during rescue, he will recover 
  his wits when you talk to him. Reported by notanumber.
  [config\gameplay\dialogs_bar.xml]
* Fox should now "ignore danger" while wounded until you heal 
  him. Reported by romulous. [config\misc\gulag_escape.ltx]
* Demo's psi suit description now has protection parameters.
  Reported by Storm Shadow State.
  [config\text\eng\string_table_enc_zone.xml]
* Fixed chance of def_box surprise spawn -- was zero after box
  workaround distance-limit tweak deployed. [xr_box.script]
* Tweaked save/load dialog list formatting for longer filenames.
  [ui_load_dialog.script, ui_save_dialog.script]
* NPP map split into two maps.  Player and target markers will 
  now better appear on the south half.  This needs further 
  refinement.  Fixes map label issue reported by BobBQ.
  [config\game_maps_single.ltx, textures\map\ui_aes_*.dds]
* Save prefix is now "filtered" for valid filename characters.
  Reported by Storm Shadow State. [ui_main_menu.script]
* One more typo. [config\text\eng\stable_task_manager.xml]

Modifier changes (NatVac):
* Quest Time Limits, Etc. 2 - Disable/enable autoquests.
  [_ZRP.cfg]
* Endurance tweak entries added.
  [Actor.cfg]
* Psi Emitters: use vanilla rupture or ZRP telepathic damage.
  [Experimental.cfg]
* Removed obsolete Kick Kruglov script from SupportUtilities 
  configuration.  Existing installs may need manual removal.
  [SupportUtilities.cfg]

Debug changes (NatVac):
* Bump bodies/boxes that have disappeared due to contact with 
  the ground: Esc D Space. See the console log to know what's 
  bumped.  Default radius about player is 10 meters.
  [_z.script]
* Toggle show_hit_damage: Esc D X.
  [_z.script]
* The variable show_hit_damage now shows damage to mutants as 
  well as NPCs.  Use log_hits = false to not add hits to PDA 
  log.  The info displayed has been cleaned up a bit.
  [xr_motivator.script, bind_monster.script]
* "Jump to unsearched body" and routines that use it now 
  place the player at the foot of the body oriented toward the 
  head.  This can be useful in a crowd of bodies.
* "Store loose weapons on bodies" now marks recipient bodies as 
  unsearched.

ZRP Support Utilities Changes (NatVac):
These changes require the re-installation of the ZSU scripts. 
If you have edited your scripts, be sure to back them up and 
merge the changes.
* Added hotkey select of certain ZSU functions if no function 
  selected (e.g., first use after dialog load).  For subsequent 
  function selection, click on the list entry or exit to game 
  and return. [scripts\optional\z_*.script]
* Added more Execute Script Command ("X") support functions.
  See docs\ZSU_ExecuteLuaCommand.txt. [z.script]
* Removed "Kick Kruglov" ZSU script, as the dialog fix is in. 
  Use the Nudge NPC script if needed (unlikely).  Please 
  remove z_kruglov_reset.script from gamedata\scripts\ if you 
  have installed the Fix Broken NPCs set of scripts -- it is 
  no longer needed.
* Fixed Set Info_portion script; was the same as the Reset
  script. [scripts\optional\z_info_portion_set.script]

=====================================
Changes in 091230 RC2 Update over ZRP 1.05 RC1 release 090912:
=====================================
Added (NatVac):
* One new dynamic level changer pair (Yantar/Army Warehouses).
  Currently enabled after normal game completion; use Esc L 
  after visiting Army Warehouses to add manually.
  [zlc.script, ui_level_zip_dialog.script, level_tasks.script]
* ZRP Support Utilities dialog. Optional, NOT default.
  (Bug fixes, workarounds, tweaks and cheats. Expandable.)
  [config\ui\ui_zrp_utils_dlg.xml, ui_main_menu.script,
  ui_zrp_utils_dialog.script.  Optionally, the "Force Possible 
  Secret" entry for the Support Utilities Modifier configuration 
  will replace treasure_manager.script.]
* Support to adjust NPP blowout countdown timer.
  [sr_timer.script]

ZRP 1.05 RC1 to RC2 Update 091230 fixes:
* Removed extra inventory texture that was wrongly stretched 
  in some wide-screen formats.  Darkened header portions to 
  improve contrast. (NatVac)
  [textures\ui\ui_inventory.dds, config\ui\inventory_new*.xml]
* Fixed threat-stance NPC pointing weapon to his left when 
  aiming at you.  (Hack from post by artistpavel)
  [state_mgr.script]
* Added fix for vanilla spawn crashes in smart_terrain.script, 
  and commented it out for speed (enable if crash encountered 
  with vanilla-all.spawn-based games in Pripyat).  Note that 
  SMM will likely remove those commented-out lines. (NatVac)
  [smart_terrain.script]
* Fix for Pripyat stadium teleport for those who didn't start a 
  new game; no teleporting into level changer unexpectedly.
  (NatVac)  [xr_effects.script]

Changes (NatVac):
* Added adjustable distance limit to box/crate workaround.
  [xr_box.script]
* Removed redundant vanilla terrain_sect entries.
  [config\gameplay\character_desc_*.xml]
* Removed Cordon road remarks from Dark Valley NPCs.
  [config\gameplay\character_desc_darkvalley.xml]
* More text corrections.
  [config\text\eng\*.xml]
* Ziphty Viper now uses GP37/G36 accuracy/damage values.
  [config\misc\_custom_items.ltx)
* No more novice replacement bandits in Cordon (more challenge).
  [config\misc\smart_terrain_presets.ltx]
* Removed unused xr_test scheme from NPCs.
  [modules.script]
* Adjusted spawn mechanism to stagger replacement spawns.  Main 
  improvement will be seen when all.spawn spawn frequency is also 
  tweaked.  You can adjust the script file further.
  [se_respawn.script]
* Enter key now selects highlighted button in main menu if named 
  save not just performed. (NatVac per romulous)
  [ui_save_dialog.script, ui_main_menu.script]
* You can spawn with just a knife in free play mode: Set the 
  variable add_nothing = true in _dev.script, then use Esc T.
  [_dev.script]

Modifier changes (NatVac):
* NPP Blowout Countdown Timer tweak added.
  [Experimental.cfg]
* A preliminary SupportUtilities configuration has been added.
  [SupportUtilities.cfg]

Debug changes (NatVac):
* You can now enable a variable to see how much damage you do.
  [xr_motivator.script]
* Fixed dynamic disabling of spawn markers. See Modifier note 
  below.  (I recall barin or dezodor or someone mentioning it.) 
  [sim_statistic.script]
The rest of these involve the same script: [_z.script]
* The direction algorithm is improved just a bit more.
* Added Esc D O to obtain all mutant parts on existing (online) 
  mutant bodies. Useful for mutants that die at level changers.
* Removed a space from a debug statement that was converted to 
  an underscore, messing up a direct copy for coordinates.
* Now you see info telling you if you don't have a standard 
  medkit to drop when using the Esc F2 shortcut.
* Replaced db.actor with actor after assignment in _z.script, 
  which will probably wreak havoc with merging.  You might be 
  able to do a find/replace of actor with db.actor on the new 
  version and then do your file compare.  But it might be 
  easier to import your changes into the updated version.

Again, PLEASE see docs\DebugSupportChanges.txt for more info.
