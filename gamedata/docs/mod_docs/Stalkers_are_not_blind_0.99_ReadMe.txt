(Additional English translation by Babel Fish and NatVac)

by Red75 

Stalkers evade anomalies.
This MOD should work with any patch up to 1.0003
You don't need to start new game after patch installation.
This mod can be used in any appropriate way, given that author's name is mentioned.

Changes in 0.99
  exact anomalies' radiuses are used, instead of guessed values
  anomaly evasion algorithm is improved
  Kruglov makes his way thru anomalies almost as fast as in vanilla game thanks to improved algorithm
  
Changes in 0.95 

  the algorithm of anomaly evasion is not discontinued at the sight of the enemy
  a table of probabilities of collision with the anomaly while in combat mode is added
  stalkers consider effective casualty radius for each type of the anomalies
  anomaly evasion algorithm is changed

Changes into 0.9 

  dynamic anomalies now supported
  the algorithm to obtain the list of anomalies is optimized
  the algorithm for anomaly evasion by stalkers is changed
  a table of probabilities of collision with the anomaly is added

====================

Notes for ZRP implementation:
  The outfit_evaluator support was removed, since it was not provided with 0.99
  Crash prevention tweaks made to anomaly_evader.script and anomaly_holder.script
  "mylog" debug calls may be changed to dbglog in some cases.  Most are not used.
