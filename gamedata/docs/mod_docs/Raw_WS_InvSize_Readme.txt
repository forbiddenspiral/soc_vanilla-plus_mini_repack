Raw's Widescreen Larger Inventory Grid
v1.01

This is just a quickie fix at making a larger grid for machines running S.T.A.L.K.E.R. on widescreen resolutions (I used 1280 x 800). It's not perfect, but i hope you like it.

Changelog:

v1.01
-Fixed a typo on one of the parameters.

v1.0
-Created the mod.


Current Annoyances:
Yes, if you use up all the rows, the last row will be incomplete. Haven't found a solution for this, and probably wont ;)

Install:

As any Mod, copy this 3 files to /gamedata/config/ui/

Thanks to Shadow State & lordmuck for pointing the right file out.

You may use this in your own mod or whatever you want, but don't forget to mention me :).

Enjoy,
Raw
